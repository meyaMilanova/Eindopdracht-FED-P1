                <h1>Sun</h1>
                <p>There is a gap,<br>
                    Like an empty room,<br>
                    A rubber room with rats,<br>
                    The rats made me crazy, --crazy,<br>
                    I was crazy once, they locked me in a room, a-, scratch that.<br>
                    Now for real. A gap.<br>
                    It grew daily,<br>
                    Small pieces falling down, each bigger than the last.<br>
                    From every lacked effort to the glasses you never put off to see me.<br>
                    Even after all my sad attempts you still didn't look.<br>
                    You saw it, you saw me,<br>
                    But you didn&#39t look,<br>
                    Because I was simply not your sun. <br>
                    Probably because I didnt feel like one then.</p>
                <p>When you were here, sadness was my best friend.<br>
                    But now that you're gone, sadness is a stranger.<br>
                    And now I see the sunrays.<br>
                    I feel happiness and I'm grasping on to it like oxygen.<br>
                    Mainly because I don't want to go back,<br>
                    Back to the time pain was home.<br>
                    The home you made and left me in alone.<br>
                    It didn't have much inside,<br>
                    Just once said and immediately after forgotten pretty words.</p>
                <p>Finally, after all this time, that lock on that door that kept me 'home',<br>
                    That blockage, that one sided pointless promise, that delusionâ€¦ <br>
                    Broke, I broke it.<br>
                    And rather than breaking me as well, it liberated me.<br>
                    Showed me happiness,<br>
                    Made me find love for myself,<br>
                    Made me realize that even though it feels the worst,<br>
                    it's no hell.<br>
                    Just a chance to change.<br>
                    Spoiler, I'm grasping on to it too.<br>
                    And I'll continue to,<br>
                    Till the moment I become a sun,<br>
                    A sun but to another.<br>
                    Another with no glasses for cover,<br>
                    Another, that doesn't act but really is a lover.</p>
